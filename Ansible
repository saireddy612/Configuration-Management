Scenario:
A 100 servers need to create and install 2 packages on each server and each package takes a 5 min for the 100 servers it 
will take 1000 min to install and it is done manually, In order to overcome this we use an automation tool
called Ansible and processed by the configruation management.
Provisioning: creating a VM's
Configuration: making changes on VM's

ANSIBLE:
It is an automation tool used to control the VM's. and it will be installed on a single virtual machine and it control
the rest of VM's and it can not work on windows, it needs python >=2.7 to be installed on the VM's. Here we will have
Anible Controller Machine and Host(Ubuntu, Centos, Windows), Ansible doesn't install on the Host Machines and it is an
agentless toll. Ansible connects the Host using secure shell.

Ansible Controller Machine:
1. Inventory
>It is a file , in which user will enter the public/private IP address of the host servers where changes have
to be done. The default location of this file is at /etc/ansible/hosts. User can also create the inventory file at particular
desired location also.
> There are two types of inventroy fieles:
>Static inventory - insert the IP address manually.
>Dynamic inventory - As the server gets created it will take IP addresses automatically.

2. Modules
>Modules are python programs that are already written and provided to you by Ansible. When you exectute these modules, 
ansible will go and make changes on desired host servers

3. Playbook
> It is the combination of Modules and inventory. which is used to perform the ansible tasks and the code is written
in YAML, and the code will convert into the python code and will transfers to the host server using SSH. Python code
will execute there.

4. Ansible.cfg
>Consists of paramaters, where it will give details of all variables (any data)

How to connect the Ansible Control Machine with Host Machine.
1. create two instances on amazon with the same key pair, name them as ACM, Host.
2. connect the instances through the terminal and give the hostname ACM, hostname Host commands
3. Now install ansible on both VM's, start with ACM
 > yum install epel-release
 > sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel
 > yum install ansible
 > vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  >Now remove # at password authentication: yes
  >place # at password authentication: No
  >:wq!
 >passwd ec2-user
  >Now create password and retype it
 >vim /etc/sudoers
  >scroll down, under root add like this  ec2-user ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
  >:wq!
  > systemctl restart sshd
4. Repeat the step no.3 on the host machine
5. ON ACM enter into the ec-user, su - ec2-user
  > ssh-keygen
  > press enter for 3 times
  > ssh-copy-id -i ec2-user@(private IP of HOST)
  >asks for password which we entered earlier
  >Now SSH connection is done, will a ssh command, using that we can shift to host machine from ACM machine directly
   with copy and pasting the ssh command on the ACM user itself.
  >exit for coming out of the host machine

How to create Inventory:
vim /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo vim hosts
> #Example 1
  172.31.14.67(individual IP address of server)
  [webservers]
  172.31.14.67(IP address of the host machine)(this format used for group servers)
  :wq!

How to create Modules:
Module1. adhoc ping command
> ansible -m ping webservers
response will be a pong from all hosts under webservers

Module2 : command
> ansible -m command -a "uptime" webservers
will give the uptime of hosts in webservers

Module3 (creating an empty file on the host from Ansible control Machine)
> ansible webservers -m command -a "touch /tmp/saireddy"
> ansible webservers -m command -a "ls -al /tmp"

To chekc all modules in ansible
> ansible-doc -l
use up arrow key and down arrow key to scroll up and down.
press q to exit

Install a tomcat package on host server using the playbook:
> sudo vim playboktomcat.yml
 > - hosts: webserver
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Install tomcat on host server
      yum: name=tomcat state=present
    - name: Start tomcat service
      service: name=tomcat state=started
> ansible-playbook playbooktomcat.yml --syntax-check
> ansible-playbook playbooktomcat.yml

Variable:
It is used to overcome the hardcode in the yml file, it has some storage to keep the data interms of value. variables
are declared at the vars block in the playbook.yml file 
Usage: var1 = value1
       var2 = value2
       {{variable_name}}--------while using the variable in the yml code
 Example:
 
 vars:
    repo_var: https://github.com/Sonal0409/AnsibleDockerdemo.git
    dest_var: /tmp/myrepo

vars_promt:
command is used for prompt asking about the image name when we are executing the ansible playbook.

example:
vars_prompt:
 - name: image_name
   prompt: enter image name
   private: false

Install a packages and building the container on the host machine:
> sudo vim playbookdockergit.yml
 >
