Scenario:
A 100 servers need to create and install 2 packages on each server and each package takes a 5 min for the 100 servers it 
will take 1000 min to install and it is done manually, In order to overcome this we use an automation tool
called Ansible and processed by the configruation management.
Provisioning: creating a VM's
Configuration: making changes on VM's

ANSIBLE:
It is an automation tool used to control the VM's. and it will be installed on a single virtual machine and it control
the rest of VM's and it can not work on windows, it needs python >=2.7 to be installed on the VM's. Here we will have
Anible Controller Machine and Host(Ubuntu, Centos, Windows), Ansible doesn't install on the Host Machines and it is an
agentless toll. Ansible connects the Host using secure shell.

Ansible Controller Machine:
1. Inventory
>It is a file , in which user will enter the public/private IP address of the host servers where changes have
to be done. The default location of this file is at /etc/ansible/hosts. User can also create the inventory file at particular
desired location also.
> There are two types of inventroy fieles:
>Static inventory - insert the IP address manually.
>Dynamic inventory - As the server gets created it will take IP addresses automatically.

2. Modules
>Modules are python programs that are already written and provided to you by Ansible. When you exectute these modules, 
ansible will go and make changes on desired host servers

3. Playbook
> It is the combination of Modules and inventory. which is used to perform the ansible tasks and the code is written
in YAML, and the code will convert into the python code and will transfers to the host server using SSH. Python code
will execute there.

4. Ansible.cfg
>Consists of paramaters, where it will give details of all variables (any data)
